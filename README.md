Some of these references have a darts board drawn, some don't. It's totally up to you how you will design the UI for this web application.



Create application that:

uses existing videobolt.net design 
works on mobile, tablet and desktop computers
is based on clean and commented code
properly uses OOP principles and design patterns
is hosted online (or you can provide instructions on how to build and run application)
